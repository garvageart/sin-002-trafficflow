# TrafficFlow

## Overview

Urban traffic light control and congestion-based routing.

Domain entities: intersections, districts, signal types.

Every class in this repo lives in a single flat package, `co.wethinkcode.trafficflow`. TrafficFlow is built
as a small set of independent services, following a growth path from simple data
cleanup through synchronous REST calls to asynchronous MQ decoupling and alerting:

1. clean a messy legacy CSV export (`intersections-legacy.csv`) — handled by **IngestionServiceApp**
2. serve it up and act on it, via three REST services calling each other directly
   over HTTP
3. decouple the relevant services with an ActiveMQ topic (`congestion-topic`) instead of
   direct calls — shared broker setup lives in [`common/`](common)
4. raise the alarm on failure — handled by **IntersectionWatchdogApp**

| Service | Folder | Port | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| IngestionServiceApp | [`ingestion-service/`](ingestion-service) | 7020 | Parses and cleans `intersections-legacy.csv` |
| IntersectionServiceApp | [`intersection-service/`](intersection-service) | 7021 | Validates intersection/district names (source of truth). |
| CongestionServiceApp | [`congestion-service/`](congestion-service) | 7022 | Tracks the city-wide Congestion Level (0-8). |
| RoutingServiceApp | [`routing-service/`](routing-service) | 7023 | Provides estimated travel times based on congestion and intersection. |
| IntersectionWatchdogApp | [`intersection-watchdog/`](intersection-watchdog) | 7024 | cries for help if the Intersection Service crashes, since routes can no longer be validated. |

Plus [`common/`](common) (no port) — the shared ActiveMQ broker and MQ config notes
for `congestion-topic`: Routing Service becomes aware of congestion changes via an ActiveMQ Topic instead of querying Congestion Service directly.

**Status:** scaffold only — build files, Javalin bootstrap, and TODOs are in place; no
business logic has been implemented yet.

## Build

Requirements: Java 17+, Maven 3.8+, Docker (for the broker in `common/`).

Every folder here (`ingestion-service/`, each domain service, and `intersection-watchdog/`) is
an **independent** Maven project — there is no parent/aggregator pom. Build one at a
time, e.g.:

```
cd intersection-service
mvn package
```

...or build every module in the repo in one pass from the project root:

```
find . -name pom.xml -execdir mvn -q package \;
```

## Run

```
# ingestion
cd ingestion-service && mvn package && java -jar target/ingestion-service.jar

# domain services, each in its own terminal
# terminal 1
cd intersection-service && mvn package && java -jar target/intersection-service.jar
# terminal 2
cd congestion-service && mvn package && java -jar target/congestion-service.jar
# terminal 3
cd routing-service && mvn package && java -jar target/routing-service.jar

# MQ broker (needed once the MQ-aware services above are wired up)
cd common && docker compose up -d

# alerting
cd intersection-watchdog && mvn package && java -jar target/intersection-watchdog.jar
```

| Service | Port |
|---|---|
| IngestionServiceApp (`ingestion-service`) | 7020 |
| IntersectionServiceApp (`intersection-service`) | 7021 |
| CongestionServiceApp (`congestion-service`) | 7022 |
| RoutingServiceApp (`routing-service`) | 7023 |
| IntersectionWatchdogApp (`intersection-watchdog`) | 7024 |

## Test

No automated tests exist yet (this is a scaffold). Each running service exposes
`/health`, so sanity-check manually:

```
curl http://localhost:7020/health   # -> OK
```

To add real tests to a module, add JUnit 5 and Surefire to its `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.junit.jupiter</groupId>
  <artifactId>junit-jupiter</artifactId>
  <version>5.10.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

```xml
<plugin>
  <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>3.2.5</version>
</plugin>
```

then add tests under that module's `src/test/java/...` and run:

```
mvn test
```
